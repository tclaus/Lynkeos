# lynkeos
The Lynkeos Astronomic Image Stacker. Modernized for macOS 10.14+. 

Based and forked form the great work from j-etienne on https://sourceforge.net/projects/lynkeos

This project should be a modernized version of the Lynkeos app. It will be as close to the original source as possible. But will use much modern macOS libs as possible.
